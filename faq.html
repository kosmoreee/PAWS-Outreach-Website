    <h1>FAQ</h1>

    <b><h2>DONATIONS</h2></b>
    <p>We accept cash donations via bank transfer, Gcash and Paypal. Donations in kind are also accepted and can be delivered to the shelter or ordered from our partner shops.</p>
    <p>The shelter and all our programs and campaigns are funded solely by donations. You can donate any amount via bank deposit or through Give2Asia (tax deductible for US donors):</p>

    <h2>Adoption and Rehoming</h2>
    <b><u><p>A pet is a lifetime commitment.</p></u></b>

    <p>However, if you truly can’t keep your adopted pet, please don’t abandon them on the streets or with strangers. Please return them to us so we can find another home for them. </p>
    <p>Applicants go through a screening process to ensure that our rescued animals go to loving homes. The process includes an online interview via Zoom and at least two (2) separate shelter visits to meet and get to know your chosen pet.</p>
    <p>PAWS does NOT adopt owned pets. We already have 300+ shelter animals rescued from cruelty and neglect that are waiting to be adopted. If you need to give up your pet for some reason, please consider other options or apply for rehoming assistance. </p>

    <u><p>Why is there an adoption fee?</p></u>
    <p>The adoption fee is a token of your commitment and and a demonstration of your financial capacity to care for a pet. P500 for cats / P1000 for dogs is a small price which already covers your pet’s spay/neuter surgery, vaccinations and tick+flea treatment. </p>

    <u><p>Can my adoption application get denied?</p></u>
    <p>Yes. Some reasons for denied applications include: Not being able to keep their pet indoors, incompatibility with the household, plus other circumstances that may be damaging to the health, safety, and happiness of our shelter animals. </p>

    <b><h2>ANIMAL CRUELTY & NEGLECT</h2></b>
    <p>WAnimal cruelty MUST be reported to your barangay officials and/or police hotline 911 immediately. You may also seek free legal assistance from PAWS. As the witness and reporting citizen, you will need to execute an affidavit so that PAWS can file the case and appear in court.</p>

    <h2>LEGAL MATTERS</h2>
    <u><p>Does the barangay/HOA have the authority to take my pets?</p></u>
    <p>If your pet is kept within your property, nobody can force you to relinquish your pet. If there are sanitation or noise complaints, there is due process with written notices and hearings where you can defend your case. Do not voluntarily surrender your pet without following due process. To avoid this issue, always keep your pet indoors and practice proper animal waste disposal.</p>

    <u><p>What can I do if a breeder/pet shop sold me a sick pet?</p></u>
    <p>This is not an animal welfare concern but an issue covered by consumer law. Please consult a private lawyer for advice. </p>

    <u><p>My pet got run over ("nasagasaan"). What can I do?</p></u>
    <p>These cases are handled by the barangay or police. You may press charges, but also remember that allowing your pet to roam freely outside your home (even in the presence of the owner) is a violation of RA9482 or The Anti Rabies Act.</p>

    <u><p>What can I do about vet malpractice?</p></u>
    <p>A comprehensive investigation, including a necropsy if your pet has died, will determine whether malpractice occurred in the treatment of your pet. Please bring your pet to a clinic that offers this service. You will also need to consult a private lawyer if you wish to press charges.</p>
